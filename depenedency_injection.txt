As the name suggests, dependency injection means to 'inject' a dependency. 
It is used for de-coupling the construction of a class from the contruction of its dependencies. 


Say there is a class A. A uses objects of a class Database. 
Dependency Injection says that 'do not' instantiate an object of the class database in class A using the 'new' keyword.
Instead, we inject this object into A. 

We create an interface that implements all the dependencies required by a particular class. 
And the class A, that uses all these dependencies,
