Depenedency Injection
This is a general design principle in programming.

As the name suggests, dependency injection means to 'inject' a dependency. 
It is used for de-coupling the construction of a class from the contruction of its dependencies. 


Say there is a class A. A uses objects of a class Database. 
Dependency Injection says that 'do not' instantiate an object of the class database in class A using the 'new' keyword.
Instead, we inject this object into A. 

Dependency Inversion Principle
We create an interface that implements all the dependencies required by class A.  
And the class A, that uses all these dependencies, will now only depend on the interface.
